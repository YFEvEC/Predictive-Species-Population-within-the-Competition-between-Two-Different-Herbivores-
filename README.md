**Project Name: Lotka-Volterra Species Competition Model**

**Description:**

This project explores the dynamics of inter-specific competition between two species (cattle and sheep) using the Lotka-Volterra competition model. The project includes a research paper and code for visualizing the competition dynamics.

**Key Features:**

- Mathematical modeling of species competition.
- Phase plane analysis for visualizing population dynamics.
- Numerical analysis to explore various scenarios.
- Investigating the impact of parameters like carrying capacities and growth rates.
- Discussion of different competition outcomes, including coexistence and extinction.

**How to Use:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. View the research paper for detailed insights into the Lotka-Volterra model and its applications.
3. Explore the Jupyter Notebook containing code for generating phase plane plots and numerical analysis.

**Contributions:**

Contributions and improvements to the project are welcome. If you have ideas for extending the analysis or visualizations, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
